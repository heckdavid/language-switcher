# Language Switcher
<br></br>
# Description 
### A user can switch from the static text that is in english to either fench or german.
### This is a educational project to gain a better understanding of the foundational web developement technologies.
### My plan is align the language switcher into a dropdown menu and have that aligned on the top right of the page.
