# Language Switcher


## Description  

### A user can switch from the static text that is in english to either fench or german.

### This is a educational project to gain a better understanding of the foundational web developement technologies.

### My plan is align the language switcher into a dropdown menu and have that aligned on the top right of the page.


## Built With
